Im planning a programmatic SEO campaign for a finnish car rental company, which does not have any one physical location but has cars in every major city in Finland.

in their website they already have geolocation landing pages and also some suburbs within those cities.

We are planning to create pages for car brands, models, more suburbs, holiday seasons and more defined in the [](database_variables.py) with the [](programmatic_structures.py)

Programmatic SEO (pSEO) is done on the basis of a database, which has dynamic variables which are used in page templates, which have placeholders for those variables.
for example like this: car rental in {city}. where {city} is a dynamic variable, which comes from the database.

I want a script which prints the final titles on the basis of these variables and programmatic structures.
